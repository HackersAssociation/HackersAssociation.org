## Presentations
Presentations can be anything, from a interesting story about a penetration test gone wrong, to a technical breakdown of a no-click 0-day in iOS. 

 - Presentations DO NOT require slides but a technical presentation attempted without slides or screen sharing may be asked to stop. 
 - Presentations should not exceed 10 minutes and will be stopped manually by the host at 11 minutes.
 - Heckling is expected but please respect the presenters and hosts by providing constructive criticism as opposed to hurling insults.
