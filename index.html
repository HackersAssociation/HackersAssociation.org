We are migrating the website to Github Pages to make collaboration easier for all HA's<br>
and to simplify hosting upkeep. While we rebuild, you can still access the old website<br>
content directly as markdown on the <a href="https://github.com/HackersAssociation/HackersAssociation.org">
		Github repo</a> for this site.<br>

In the meantime, visit us on Discord: <a href="https://discord.gg/yMvbvst">https://discord.gg/yMvbvst</a>
